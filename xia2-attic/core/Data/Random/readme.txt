Random data
-----------

This is to allow random allocation of readable names. All of these names are
from a list of surnames at:

http://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/dist.all.last

Which is suitably random. The names were lowercased and put in names.txt.

This contains only the characters a-z, no spaces, no punctuation.
